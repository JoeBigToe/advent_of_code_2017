# Advent of Code 
Every year, around christmas season, untammed minds get teased with a set of small programming puzzles, known by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

For the year 2017, I chose to solve the puzzles in Python 3.6. If you are curious about the output of any of these puzzles, just run for example:

```
python .\day1.py
```

**Disclaimer**: None of these solutions were developed with performance in mind, so please don't judge me on optimization.
